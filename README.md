# Thinking in React

This project is based on the [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) tutorial.

## How State and Props Work in the Application

- **Props** are used to pass data from parent components to child components, making the UI dynamic and reusable.
- **State** is used to manage data that changes over time within a component, such as user interactions or filtering data.
- The application follows a unidirectional data flow, where state is lifted to the common ancestor component and passed down as props.

This approach ensures a clear structure and predictable rendering in the application.
